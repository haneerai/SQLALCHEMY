The foreign key from Engineer to Employee is used not for a relationship, but to establish joined inheritance between the two classes.

This means automap will not generate any relationships for foreign keys that link from a subclass to a superclass.
If a mapping has actual relationships from subclass to superclass as well, those need to be explicitly stated
